# How to Setup Staking

1. Download the latest wallest:

    - [https://github.com/BlocknetDX/blocknet/releases/latest]
 
2. Let the wallet sync. This process should start automatically.

3. While waiting to sync, encrypt the wallet by going to Settings > Encrypt Wallet
    - A prompt to create a password will appear. Make sure to backup this password in a safe place. It may be required to restart the wallet after this.

4. Once fully synced, you will need to deposit funds to the wallet.
    - To view your wallet address, go to File > Receiving addresses

5. To start staking, go to Settings > Unlock Wallet. Check the "For anonymization and staking only" box, enter the password created above, click the "OK" button.

6. When the wallet is staking successfully, you will see a green circle with and up-arrow at the bottom right corner of the wallet.
    - If the funds were just deposited for the first time, the funds need to mature(reach confirmation threshold) so it may take and hour or so for the icon to turn green
